                    preferences.</p>

                <h3>Why and How We Use Cookies</h3>
                <p>Cookie files help us to provide our Website operation, customized functionality, and improved and
                    safe
                    usability. Due to cookies we may record our users browsing activity, verify our users accounts to

                    her during next visits and customize the use and search. E.g., if the User indicates his/her
                    preference, this preference will be stored in an appropriate Cookie file (the cookie name:
                    civicCookieControl)</p>

                <p>In order to improve our Website use and collect information on how you use our Website, what pages
                    are
                    used and other similar usage data, we can use Google Analytics (example of the cookie name: _ga,
                    etc.)</p>

                <p>We may use first party cookies and third party cookies, so that our User can log in to our Website
                    services, memorize preferences and settings, keep the User&rsquo;s account safe and protected,
                    promote our services, etc.</p>

                <p>Cookie files that we can use and apply on our Website are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Session cookies</strong> (Temporary or Transient cookie)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Session cookies are erased when the User closes the web browser. The session cookie is stored in

                    the data from the User&rsquo;s device. Therefore, when you restart your browser and return to the
                    used website that made such cookie, this website will not remember or recognise you.</p>
                <ul>

                    based on the duration period contained within the persistent cookie's file or until you delete it
                    manually. These cookies are used to collect and store the User&rsquo;s identifying data (e.g.,
                    searching behavior, preferences, etc.)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First Party and Third Party cookies</strong></li>
